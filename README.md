# Daily Planner for Effective Time Management

This homework assignment involves creating a daily planner application that allows employees with busy schedules to add important events and effectively manage their time. The planner will display the current day at the top of the calendar and provide timeblocks for standard business hours. The timeblocks will be color-coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future. The user can enter events into the timeblocks and save them, with the saved events persisting even after refreshing the page.

## Summary

The daily planner accomplishes the following:

- Upon opening the planner, the current day is displayed prominently at the top of the calendar, providing users with instant awareness of the current date.

- Scrolling down reveals timeblocks for standard business hours, allowing users to plan their day effectively.

- Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. This visual cue helps users quickly identify the current timeframe and upcoming events.

- By clicking into a timeblock, users can enter and edit events or important tasks associated with that specific hour.

- When the user clicks the save button for a timeblock, the entered text is saved in local storage, ensuring that the events persist even after refreshing the page.

By developing this daily planner application, employees can conveniently manage their time by adding and tracking important events throughout the day. The color-coded interface provides a visual overview of the schedule, enabling users to prioritize tasks effectively. The ability to save events in local storage ensures that the information remains accessible, allowing users to stay organized even after closing and reopening the application.
